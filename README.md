## Project Description

This repository contains our group project work, we aimed to answer questions through visualizations of the data provided. 


This project aims to improve post-earthquake response efforts by using visual analytics to determine how emergency responders can adjust their efforts based on damage reports from citizens. The reliability of neighbourhood damage reports will be evaluated by comparing them to ground truth data, and neighbourhoods providing reliable reports will be prioritised for response efforts. Visual analytics techniques such as choropleth maps will be used to identify the hardest hit areas of the city and provide detailed information about the level and types of damage. Uncertainty in the reported data will be shown using error bars and confidence intervals, allowing for a better understanding of the level of certainty in the data. Over time, visual analytics can be used to track changes in the level of damage and uncertainty, providing updated information to emergency responders and government officials to inform ongoing response efforts and adjust resource allocation as needed.
