            <p>Our project involves providing emergency response planners in St. Himark with valuable information about
                the effects of
                a recent earthquake that hit the city. Emergency responders have already used seismic readings to deploy
                initial resources,
                but they require more information to effectively allocate resources and understand the extent of the
                damage.
                The city had recently released a damage reporting mobile application that allows citizens to provide
                real-time damage reports.
                By using the app responses along with seismic readings and background knowledge of the city, we can help
                triage efforts for rescue and recovery.
